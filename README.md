My copy of [GNU units][units] had currency definitions a decade old! You know
what never has that and does unit conversions? Google! Here’s an always-online
command-line alternative to GNU units, useful for fluxuating units such as
currency conversions. Ideally, it’ll also function as a command-line calculator
/ do-whatever-Google’s-cards-can-do app.

Current status: not working at all.

Build:

    dotnet build src -c release

Use:

    ???
